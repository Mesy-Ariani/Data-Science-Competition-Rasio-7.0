Background: 		In today's digital and rapidly globalizing world, there are many countries that need to catch up, facing issues related to food security and nutrition for their populations. Leveraging digitalization, we aimed to provide insights that can inform the identification of clusters of countries experiencing these challenges with Spatial Temporal DBSCAN Clustering. 
We address this problem in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically focusing on Goal 2: "End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture," especially Target 2.1 and Target 2.2. The data we used is based on indicators employed by the Global Hunger Index (GHI), which we have adapted for various reasons. The foundational indicators for calculating GHI include Undernourishment, Child Stunting, Child Mortality, and Child Wasting. However, our adaptation involves replacing Child Wasting with Women's Anemia due to insufficient annual reporting data for Child Wasting from many countries We choose Women's Anemia as part of our adaptation because it adequately represents a country's food-related challenges.

Goal: 
1. Implement Spatio Temporal Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (ST-DBSCAN) clustering algorithm to clusterize countries globally based on hunger indicators.
2. Find the best clustering based on Silhouette Coefficient and minimum number of noises.
3. Generate clear insight into the causes of hunger and provide recommendations.

Data: The data used is secondary data of panel type obtained from the UN Statistics Division (UNStats) and the Inter-Agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME). The data consists of a combination of cross-sections which are shown on observations of countries in the world, and time series which are shown on observations from 2012 to 2019.
